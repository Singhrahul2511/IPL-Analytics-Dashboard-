## ✨ Key Features

### UI/UX & Interactivity
-   **Dynamic Dashboard**: Single Page Application (SPA) feel with no page reloads.
-   **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern layout that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Interactive Charts**: Powered by Plotly.js for engaging and informative visualizations.
-   **Searchable Dropdowns**: User-friendly `Choices.js` integration for easy filtering.
-   **Smart Loading**: UI shows loading spinners during API calls for a smooth user experience.

### Advanced Analytics
-   **Team Head-to-Head**: Deep dive into team matchups with filters for **Season** and **Venue**.
-   **Toss vs. Match Win Correlation**: See how often winning the toss translates to winning the match.
-   **Win Margin & Streak Analysis**: Uncover team dominance with average/max win margins and longest winning streaks.
-   **Player vs. Player**: Detailed analysis of a batsman's performance against a specific bowler.
-   **Performance by Phase**: Analyze player stats in the **Powerplay**, **Middle Overs**, and **Death Overs**.

### Machine Learning Integration
-   **Win Predictor**: A lightweight `scikit-learn` (Logistic Regression) model predicts match outcomes based on teams, venue, and toss details.
-   **Efficient Model Serving**: The pre-trained model is saved as a `.pkl` file for fast loading and low resource usage, perfect for free hosting tiers.

## ⚙️ Local Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ipl-analytics-dashboard.git](https://github.com/your-username/ipl-analytics-dashboard.git)
cd ipl-analytics-dashboard



2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

Bash

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Train the Machine Learning Model
This is a one-time step. Run this script to create the win_predictor.pkl file in the model/ directory.

Bash

python train_model.py
5. Run the Application
Start the Flask development server.

Bash

python app.py
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

☁️ Deployment to Render
This project is configured for a seamless deployment on Render's free tier.

1. Host on GitHub
Create a new repository on your GitHub account.

Push your project code (including the model/win_predictor.pkl file) to this repository.

2. Deploy on Render
Sign up for a Render account.

On the dashboard, click "New +" and select "Web Service".

Connect your GitHub account and select the repository you just created.

Render will automatically detect your project. Fill in the settings:

Name: Give your service a unique name (e.g., ipl-dashboard-yourname).

Root Directory: Leave this blank if your app.py is in the root.

Runtime: Select Python 3.

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt (This is usually the default).

Start Command: gunicorn app:app (Render automatically detects this from your Procfile).

Click "Create Web Service". Render will pull your code, install the dependencies, and start the application. Your dashboard will be live at the URL provided by Render in a few minutes!
